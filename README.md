Cat and Dog Finder
Welcome to the Cat and Dog Finder repository! This project is part of my internship in machine learning, where I developed a model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is built using the dataset provided by Whenamancodes on Kaggle.

Dataset
The dataset contains images of cats and dogs, which are divided into two categories:

Cat images
Dog images
Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes, including task_3.ipynb where the SVM model is developed.
models/: Saved models and model architecture.
src/: Source code for data processing, model building, and utility functions.
README.md: Project overview and setup instructions.
Model
The model is built using Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are effective for binary classification tasks. Key features of the model include:

Data Preprocessing: Techniques such as resizing, normalization, and feature extraction using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).
Model Selection: Fine-tuning hyperparameters of the SVM to optimize performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
